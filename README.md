### Pixabay Technical Test

This project is a technical test that showcases a modern Android application development using Kotlin and the latest tech stack.

The app uses the [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/#api_search_images) API service to display the image list based on the search query. It follows the Clean Architecture principles, the Repository Pattern, and the MVVM Architecture. It also uses Jetpack Compose UI toolkit in the presentation layer.

You can download APK file from [this link](https://github.com/msddev/PayBack-Technical-Test/releases/download/v1.0.0/Pixabay-Test.apk).

## Features

1. **Offline-first**: The app can be accessed even without an internet connection.
2. **Pagination**: Efficiently loads large amounts of data to improve the user experience.
3. **Search functionality**: Allows users to quickly find specific information within the app.


## Environment Setup

This project is developed with Android Studio ```Hedgehog (2023.1.1)```.

## Architecture
A well-planned architecture is extremely important for an app to scale and manage the complexity of the code. All architectures have one common goal: to separate the concerns of different modules and layers. This makes it easier to modify, test, and maintain the code.

The clean architecture was proposed by [Robert C. Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) in 2012 in the [Clean Code Blog](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) and it follows the SOLID principle.

### Why Clean Architecture?
- ```Loose coupling between the code``` - The code can easily be modified without affecting any or a large part of the app's codebase thus easier to scale the application later on.
- Easier to ```test``` code.
- ``` Separation of Concern``` - Different modules have specific responsibilities making it easier for modification and maintenance.

### Data
The ```data``` layer is responsible for selecting the proper data source for the domain layer. It contains the implementations of the repositories declared in the domain layer.

Components of the data layer include:
- __dataSource__: Represent the component of the data layer and are responsible for managing the data of a particular source (internet, Room, data store, and suchlike)

- __local__: This is responsible for performing caching operations using ```Room``` database.

- __remote__: This is responsible for performing network operations eg. defining API endpoints using ```Retrofit```.

- __di__: Provides the data layer dependencies using ```Dagger Hilt``` dependency injection library.

- __mapper__: Facilitate data transformation between the Data layer and the Domain layer, ensuring a CLEAN (CLear, Encapsulated) architecture.

- __mediator__: Defines a set of callbacks used to incrementally load data from a remote source into a local source wrapped by a PagingSource, e.g., loading data from network into a local db cache.

- __repository__: Responsible for exposing data to the domain layer.

### Domain
This is the core layer of the application. The ```domain``` layer is independent of any other layers thus ] domain business logic can be independent from other layers. This means that changes in other layers will have no effect on the domain layer eg.  screen UI (presentation layer) or changing database (data layer) will not result in any code change within the domain layer.

### Presentation
The ```Presentation``` layer contains components involved in showing information to the user. The main parts of this layer are the views(Activity, and Jetpack Compose Screens) and ViewModels.
